## Quality Gates

### Code Reviews

* At least 2 developers must approve all code changes made before they can be merged into the integration branch.

### Automated testing

* This consists primarily of unit testing.

### Automated Style Checking

* Clang format is enabled â€“ currently this follows the style guidelines established for our libraries,
 and it may be updated from time to time. See .clang-format for more details.

### Continuous Integration

* A GitLab CI pipeline is being used to run builds and tests that enforce all supported quality gates for all merge
requests, and for generating new binary builds from main. See .gitlab-ci.yml for details.

### Automated Dynamic Analysis

* When Linux is supported, ASAN will be used when running all automated tests to catch various memory errors during runtime.

## Revision Control
